<h1>LOFAR</h1>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.lofar.org/">LOFAR</a>, the LOw Frequency ARray, is an
  innovative new radio telescope currently under construction in the
  Netherlands, which will continuously monitor the radio sky in the frequency
  range 10&ndash;240 MHz.
</p>

<h1>Transients Key Project</h1>

<p>
  The study of transient sources is one of the key science projects of LOFAR.
  Under this remit come all time-variable astronomical radio sources,
  including pulsars, gamma-ray bursts, X-ray binaries, radio supernovae, flare
  stars, and even exo-planets.  With its continuous monitoring of a large area
  of sky, it is hoped that LOFAR will detect many new transient events, and
  provide alerts to the international community for follow-up observations at
  other wavelengths. The project has been subdivided into four basic
  scientific working groups:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jet sources: AGN, GRBs, accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes</li>
  <li>Pulsars: classical radio pulsars, AXPs, RRATs</li>
  <li>Planets: solar system objects and exoplanets</li>
  <li>Flare stars: M, L, and T dwarfs and active binaries</li>
</ul>
