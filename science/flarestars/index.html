<h1>LOFAR Transients Key Project Science Case</h1>

<h2>Flare Stars Working Group</h2>

<p>Particles accelerated in the presence of the magnetic fields produce
radio emissions, seen in the Sun in a wide variety of phenomena, and also
observed in nearby active stars. As described in <a
href="#Gudel2002">G&uuml;del (2002)</a>, it is now known that stellar radio
emission occurs across the HR diagram, with a variety of manifestations.
Those objects in the cool half of the HR diagram, lying roughly near the main
sequence and with spectral types F and later, display predominantly
nonthermal emission. This nonthermal emission is intimately connected with
the presence of magnetic fields whose dynamical rearrangement during magnetic
reconnection processes can lead to transient increases in associated
emissions.  For the flare stars working group we concentrate on three classes
of cool stellar objects which have displayed evidence of coherent radio
emission, and are likely sources of transient metric radio emission: active
binaries (cool close binaries whose tidal locking enforces fast rotation and
enhanced magnetic activity); dMe flare stars (M dwarf flare stars with a rich
history of producing dramatic magnetic-reconnection events from metric to
hard X-ray wavelengths); and ultracool dwarfs (dwarfs of spectral type M7 and
cooler which display evidence of strong surface magnetic fields and pulsed
radio emission).</p>

<p>Observations of cool stars at radio wavelengths trace the dynamics of
interacting magnetic fields through the action of accelerated particles.
Accelerated particles are a main component of magnetic reconnection whose
importance is not appreciated in the stellar community, as they are generally
difficult to observe. Observations are needed which can return direct
constraints on the nature of accelerated electrons in stellar flares, which
can be obtained via analysis of the spectral and temporal properties of low
frequency radio bursts. White light stellar flares have historically been the
way in which stellar flares were studied, although stellar flares have now
been detected at wavelengths from meter-wave (<a href="#Kundu1988">Kundu
&amp; Shevgaonkar 1988</a>) to hard X-rays (<a href="#Osten2007">Osten et al.
2007</a>).  The inability of a solar-type electron beam input in stellar
flares (<a href="#Allred2006">Allred et al. 2006</a>) suggests that the
accelerated particles present in stellar flares may represent a break with
the solar model.</p>

<p>Solar flares have associated coronal mass ejections which typically
produce slowly drifting radio bursts at meter wavelengths; magnetically
active stars with a high flaring rate should have a similarly high rate of
mass ejections. Studies in the meter wavelength domain can thus provide an
alternate means of constraining the amount of mass lost in cool stars, an
important but difficult measurement to make. This is crucial input to studies
of planetary habitability, as a major uncertainty in the effect of large
stellar flares on planetary (Earthlike) atmospheres is the action of
energetic particles (<a href="#Segura2010">Segura et al. 2010</a>) and the
frequency of coronal mass ejections (<a href="#Khodachenko2007">Khodachenko
et al. 2007</a>). The field of radio transient studies is a growing one, and
further characterization of known sources of transient radio emission is
crucial to enable better identification and separation of new, unknown
classes of transients, particularly in instances where the phase space of
measurable transient characteristics may overlap.</p>

        showing the highly structured nature of a stellar radio burst at dm
        wavelengths as viewed in the frequency-time domains.  The
        sub-structure appears to consist of individual radiating elements
        (each ~2 ms in duration at a given frequency) which proceed
        from high frequency to low frequency, and have the same sign and
        sense of frequency drift.  Consideration of the timescales and
        frequencies involved led Osten &amp; Bastian to conclude that they were
        seeing accelerated particles drifting along magnetic fields in the
        corona.  At the lower frequencies/longer wavelengths probed by
        LOFAR, we will see many examples of the action of accelerated
        particles in stellar atmospheres such as this.
