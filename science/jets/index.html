<h1>LOFAR Transients Key Project Science Case</h1>

<h2>Jets Working Group</h2>

<p>The process of accretion powers the most energetic phenomena known in
the Universe, from around supermassive black holes at the centres of
galaxies (active galactic nuclei; AGN), their stellar-mass analogues (X-ray
binaries; XRBs), as well as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the hyper-energetic
explosions detected out to the edge of the visible Universe.  In all cases,
the accretion process is often directly coupled to outflow from the systems
in the form of powerful, collimated jets, which can in some cases be
accelerated close to the speed of light.  The presence of relativistic
electrons and magnetic fields in the jets imply that they emit synchrotron
radiation.  Although this synchrotron emission is known to extend up through
the X-ray bands in several classes of sources, it is most easily detected in
the radio regime, where it is the dominant emission process.  The Jets
Working Group aims to use LOFAR to monitor the synchrotron emission from any
class of system producing transient, high-energy outflows (including the
aforementioned accreting sources, the newly-discovered class of tidal
disruption events, as well as outflows from young stellar objects, magnetars
and supernovae) with the following primary goals</p>

<h3>To understand the activity cycles of accreting sources</h3>

<p>Accreting Galactic compact objects, be they black holes, neutron stars,
or even white dwarfs, spend the majority of their time in a relatively
low-luminosity state.  Occasionally, they undergo spectacular outbursts, in
which their luminosities increase by several orders of magnitude.  These
outbursts have in the past been detected primarily by high-energy X-ray and
gamma-ray satellites, with occasional triggered radio monitoring to connect
the changing behaviour of the jets to the changes in the accretion disc that
caused them.  Previous such studies have shown a one-to-one connection
between X-ray spectral and variability properties and the morphology of the
jets (e.g.  <a href="#Fender2004">Fender, Belloni &amp; Gallo 2004</a>) but
the sporadic nature of the radio observations to date has meant that the
details of this connection remain unclear.  The radio sky monitoring
capability provided by LOFAR will finally provide high-cadence radio
monitoring of such outbursts, allowing a detailed correlation of the radio
and X-ray light curves, to determine the causal relationship between changes
in the accretion flow and subsequent changes in the jets.  Similar activity
cycles are believed to exist in AGN (e.g. <a
href="#Koerding2006">K&ouml;rding, Jester & Fender 2006</a>), albeit on much
longer timescales, so advancing our understanding of one class of
jet-producing sources will have implications for all the others.  There is
also a possibility that new, radio-only accretion states will be discovered,
that are not accompanied by X-ray activity.

<h3>To determine the feedback effect of the jets on their surroundings</h3>

<p>The jets provide a significant input of kinetic energy, momentum, and
magnetized plasma into their surroundings.  They are also an important
source of particle acceleration, and have been proposed as a potential
origin of cosmic ray particles.  The energy injected into the interstellar
medium by Galactic X-ray binaries has been calculated to be several percent
of the time-averaged kinetic luminosity of supernovae (<a
href="#Fender2005">Fender, Maccarone & van Kesteren 2005</a>).  On larger
scales, the feedback effect of jets from AGN can influence the evolution of
galaxies and even galaxy clusters, in extreme cases heating the entire
intracluster gas by almost a keV!  The low frequencies of LOFAR allow us to
probe larger spatial scales for a given baseline length, and are sensitive
to older synchrotron-aged electrons.  This allows us to study extended
emission at large distances from the compact object driving the jets, thus
helping us to determine the impact of the jets on their surroundings.</p>

<h3>To investigate the behaviour of matter in extreme conditions</h3>

<p>Extending the spectral energy distributions of transient sources into the
MHz band with high-cadence, time-resolved monitoring will provide a
low-frequency constraint for spectral modelling, helping to determine the
contribution of the jets to emission at higher frequencies.  This is crucial
in understanding the emission mechanisms in the X-ray band, and hence the
behaviour of matter in the strong-gravity, high-magnetic field, high-energy
conditions prevalent close to accreting compact objects, which we can never
hope to reproduce here on Earth.</p>

<h3>Serendipity?</h3>

<p>It has been suggested that some accretion events (such as GRBs) may kick
off with a burst of coherent emission.  The wide field of view of LOFAR
enables high-cadence monitoring of large volumes of sky, opening up
sufficient parameter space to detect such bursts, should they exist.</p>

        Modeling results of the afterglow of GRB 030329 at centimetre
        wavelengths. Light curves are shown from the WSRT, GMRT, VLA, ATCA
        &amp; Ryle Telescopes. Three fits to the data are shown: the dotted
        line represents a fit to the first 100 days of radio observations
        with a wide jet expanding in a homogeneous medium; the solid line
        corresponds to a model in which the blast wave becomes
        non-relativistic after 80 days; the dash-dotted line corresponds to
        a model in which a third jet-component with an even wider opening
        angle is present. The latter model is excluded by the observations
        below 1 GHz, which leaves the model with the non-relativistic phase
        after 80 days as the preferred model for the late-time behaviour of
        the blast wave.  Thus low-frequency observations can be crucial in
        interpreting the physics of the jets and their interaction with
        their surroundings.  Figure taken from <a href="#vdHorst2007">van
