<h3><a name="sect1">1.</a> General Introduction to Pulsars and Fast Transients with LOFAR</h3>

  <p>Pulsars are rapidly rotating, highly magnetised neutron stars that were
  first identified via pulsed radio emission at the very low radio observing
  frequency of 81 MHz (Hewish et al. 1968). They have subsequently been
  shown to emit pulsations across the electromagnetic spectrum, at
  frequencies ranging from 17 MHz to above 87 GHz (e.g. Bruk &amp; Ustimenko
  1976, 1977; Morris et al. 1997) in the radio and at optical, X-ray and
  γ-ray wavelengths (see Thompson 2000 and references therein), although the
  vast majority are seen to emit only at radio wavelengths. These pulsations
  provide invaluable insights into the nature of neutron star physics, and
  most neutron stars would be otherwise undetectable with current
  telescopes. Though radio pulsars form over 85% of the known neutron star
  population, they are generally very weak radio sources with pulsed flux
  densities ranging from 0.0001 to 5 Jy with a median of 0.01 Jy at a
  frequency of 400 MHz. The pulsed flux density at radio wavelengths
  exhibits a steep powerlaw spectrum (alpha = -1.8) that often peaks and
  turns over at frequencies between 100 and 200 MHz (Kuzmin et al. 1978;
  Slee et al. 1986; Malofeev et al. 1994).</p>

  <p>After their discovery, a lot of the early work on pulsars (e.g. Cole
  1969; Staelin &amp; Reifenstein 1968; Rankin et al. 1970) continued at low
  radio frequencies (defined here as &lt; 300 MHz). However, despite the
  fact that most pulsars are intrinsically brightest in this frequency
  range, since then the vast majority of pulsars have been discovered and
  studied at frequencies in the range 300&ndash;2000 MHz; much of our
  knowledge of the properties of the radio emission mechanism stems from
  studies at these frequencies and above.  There are three main reasons for
  this: the deleterious effects of the interstellar medium (ISM) on pulsed
  signals; the effective background sky temperature of the Galactic
  synchrotron emission; and ionospheric effects. All three of these effects
  have steep power law dependencies on frequency and therefore become worse
  towards lower frequencies. Combined with the generally steep spectra of
  pulsars, these effects conspire to make observing frequencies of roughly
  300&ndash;2000 MHz the range of choice for most pulsar studies and
  searches.</p>

  <p>However, despite these challenges, there are many reasons why it is
  important and interesting to observe pulsars in a significantly lower
  frequency regime than now commonly used. In recent years some excellent
  studies have continued at frequencies between 20&ndash;110 MHz mainly
  using the Pushchino, Gauribidanur and UTR-2 telescopes (e.g. Malov &amp;
  Malofeev 2010; Malofeev et al. 2000; Asgekar &amp; Deshpande 2005; Popov
  et al. 2006b; Ulyanov et al. 2006). These studies have begun to map, e.g.,
  the low-frequency spectra, pulse morphologies, and pulse energy
  distributions of pulsars, but have in some cases been limited by the
  available bandwidths and/or polarisation and tracking capabilities of
  these telescopes.</p>

  <p>LOFAR provides a great leap forward in low-frequency radio observations
  by providing large fractional bandwidths and sophisticated multi-beaming
  capabilities.  LOFAR has excellent properties for the study of known
  pulsars, and its huge field of view (FoV) makes it a powerful survey
  telescope for finding new pulsars and other &quot;fast-transients&quot;.
  In the following, we elaborate on many of the exciting scientific
  topics.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2.</a> The Pulsar Emission Mechanism</h3>

<h4>Long Term Properties</h4>

  <p>The steep increase in the pulsed flux density of pulsars towards lower
  frequencies is seen to turn over for many pulsars around 100&ndash;250
  MHz. However, some pulsars lack a spectral break in this region and even
  lower-frequency studies from 10&ndash;90 MHz are needed. For understanding
  the emission process and for modeling the pulsar population, it is very
  important to understand this spectral shape, but so far there are
  relatively few spectra that extend into the LOFAR HBA frequency range, and
  even fewer that extend to LBA frequencies (e.g. Malofeev 2000). Of
  particular interest are millisecond pulsars (MSPs) which appear to
  increase in intrinsic brightness well into the LBA band (e.g. Kramer et
  al. 1999). Is this related to the different field structure and strength
  compared with the unrecycled pulsars?  LOFAR will be able to greatly
  increase the number of measured spectra.  In the case of MSPs, for which
  emission may be scattered, we can get flux density measurements from
  continuum images. For the majority of pulsars, however, we will directly
  measure pulsed fluxes, including the spectral indices of individual pulse
  components.  Correlating the spectral properties (e.g. spectral index and
  turn-over frequencies), with other properties of the pulsar (e.g. pulse
  shape, geometry and energetics) promises important insight into physical
  relationships, pulsar emission and geometry models (e.g. Lorimer &amp;
  Kramer 2005, Handbook of Pulsar Astronomy, CUP).  The average pulse
  profiles of radio pulsars are the sum of a large number of single pulses
  and reflect the long-term conditions in the pulsar magnetosphere. We
  expect the plasma dynamics and emission properties to be dominated by the
  dipolar magnetic field, and the emission to obey a
  &quot;radius-to-frequency mapping&quot; (RFM), such that lower frequencies
  are emitted further out in the magnetosphere (see Cordes 1978). There is
  some evidence for an evolution from &quot;cone&quot; emission at high
  frequencies to &quot;core&quot; emission at lower frequencies, possibly
  related to the 3-D distribution of plasma along the field lines and
  emission zones. In reality,the picture is often much more complex. For
  example our LOFAR commissioning observations are already seeing
  significant deviations from these simple relations when considering the
  wide frequency bands of LOFAR combined with simultaneous high frequency
  observations (Hassall et al 2012).</p>

  <p>By extending this initial comparison of the profile evolution that
  will be visible over LOFAR's huge fractional bandwidth with profiles
  at higher frequencies, we can investigate these properties for a much
  larger class of pulsars than previously possible. A further important
  indicator of the relationship between the emission mechanism, the
  geometry, and the magnetosphere is the polarisation, which has seen
  very limited studies at low-frequencies so far. In simultaneous
  multiple high-frequency observations, strange polarisation variations
  have been seen which point directly to the physics of the emission
  regions (Karastergiou et al. 2001). Polarisation studies with LOFAR
  will provide insight into important questions such as how does the
  percentage polarisation evolve, is the polarisation position angle
  swing more or less complicated, and do polarisation properties change
  below the spectral break?</p>

<h4>Physics of the Pulsar Magnetosphers</h4>

  <p>Our limited knowledge of the exact mechanism of pulsar radio emission,
  and the way it evolves during a pulsar's life, has only allowed us to
  classify pulsars according to certain phenomenological manifestations.
  More and more we are discovering that pulsars show variations in their
  emission properties on a whole range of timescales. There are a growing
  number that have two or more known modes of emission, each one producing
  significantly different average-pulse characteristics (i.e. the moding
  pulsars, like PSR J0538+2817); there are pulsars that occasionally produce
  single bursts or trails of successive pulses but remain invisible for most
  of the time (i.e. Rotating radio transients or &quot;RRATS&quot;, like
  J1819-1503); and there are other phenomenological classes, like the
  intermittent pulsars (e.g. PSR B1931+24), which appear ordinary when they
  are visible (bright mode) but occasionally "switch off" and stay invisible
  for significant lengths of time (e.g. 80% of the time in "quiet mode").
  Most recently even some of those that show mode changes where the pulse
  profile changes, even subtly, have associated changes in their spin
  properties (Lyne et al 2010). The timescales associated with the above
  emission modes make it likely that these phenomena are related to pulsar
  magnetospheric physics and that dedicated polarisation observations may be
  part of our key to understanding the underlying mechanism — and perhaps
  connect the various manifestations under a single mechanism. Recent
  observations with LOFAR have serendipitously recorded single pulses from
  the intermittent pulsar PSR B0823+26 during transition between its bright
  and quiet modes (Sobey et al., 2012 in preparation). This provided a
  unique data set containing high time and frequency resolution polarisation
  information, which allowed us to get a glimpse of the process of
  transition between modes. Interestingly, the data revealed intrinsic
  changes in the pulse morphology on timescales of a pulse period; these
  changes are possibly connected to the way plasma is distributed along the
  open field lines and may be an important clue to the general mechanism in
  pulsars that also explains the rest of phenomenological classes.
  Monitoring intermittent and moding pulsars with LOFAR has the potential of
  providing more of these rare glimpses of variable pulsar magnetospheric
  activity.</p>

<h4>Short Term Properties</h4>

  <p>Our calculations show that in the LOFAR high band single pulses can be
  detected with reasonable signal-to-noise from at least one-third of
  pulsars while in the low band it is about one-quarter of pulsars. This is
  a very large increase on what has previously been possible and, when
  combined with LOFAR's ability to track sources, allows for a rich study of
  the emission physics. The quality of what is already possible with LOFAR
  single pulse observations is astounding (Stappers et al 2011).  LOFAR will
  also be able to detect single pulses from MSPs, presently possible for
  just a few sources, and will allow us to compare, for the first time, the
  effects of mode changing, nulling and drifting subpulses (see Lorimer
  &amp; Kramer 2005) of MSPs with their younger, higher magnetic field,
  slower spinning brethren.  In some pulsars, subpulses are observed to
  drift in an organised fashion through the pulse window (e.g.  Weltevrede
  et al. 2007). While drifting may be due to conditions within the pulsar
  magnetosphere, some pulsars show significant frequency evolution in the
  properties of these drifting subpulses. Low frequencies potentially probe
  a different sight line, but possibly a different height above the surface.
  Hence, LOFAR can be used to reconstruct the distribution of emission
  within the magnetosphere and constrain the location of the emission, while
  even greater constraints can be obtained by long simultaneous
  multi-frequency observations across the wide LOFAR bands and also in
  combination with high frequency telescopes (&gt;1 GHz).  There is also
  some evidence that both pulse intensities and drifting are less stable at
  low frequencies (Weltevrede et al.  2007). The greatly increased sample of
  pulsars for which single pulse studies with LOFAR are possible will help
  to confirm or refute this.  Combining simultaneous multi-frequency
  observations of radio pulsars using multiple telescopes has proved very
  successful at revealing much about the processes discussed above (e.g.
  Karastergiou et al. 2001; Hassall et al 2012b, in prep.). Unfortunately,
  similar studies at low frequency have been hampered until now by the fact
  that, unlike LOFAR, the majority of available telescopes are transit
  instruments and so only short simultaneous observations are possible.
  Using LOFAR and high-frequency instruments simultaneously, we have already
  shown that we can study long trains of single pulses and can probe
  microstructure (quasi-periodic emission features seen in some pulsars with
  periods and widths on the order of microseconds). We would expect the
  density imbalances and plasma dynamics to be the most noticeable at low
  radio frequencies, so that their study can strongly influence emission
  models. While the high time resolution requirement of these observations
  and the existence of interstellar scattering will limit the number of
  pulsars that can be studied, there remain many tens of sources for which
  this can be done, making this a particularly exciting area of study.</p>

<h3><a name="sect3">3.</a> Pulsar Timing</h3>

  <p>While ultra-high-precision pulsar timing (at the ns to &micro;second
  level) is not possible at low radio frequencies, understanding how a
  stable pulse profile used for pulsar timing is formed from the single
  pulses is absolutely crucial for enabling precision experiments in the SKA
  era (Cordes et al. 2004; Liu et al 2011). We will therefore investigate
  how the short-term properties will lead to the overall long-term
  properties and how we can translate this into enhanced timing performance.
  Moreover, LOFAR's large FoV, multi-beaming capability, and the
  availability and sensitivity of single stations enable many pulsars to be
  timed at sufficient precision and cadence to be of great scientific
  interest.  Regular monitoring of the rotational behaviour of radio pulsars
  plays an important role in understanding the internal structure and spin
  evolution of neutron stars and how they emit. It is also an important
  probe of the interstellar medium and potentially for the emission of
  gravitational waves. Measuring dispersion measure variations and modeling
  the scattering of pulse profiles at LOFAR frequencies has the potential to
  help improve pulse shapes and changes therein and thus enhance high
  precision timing (e.g. You et al 2007; Demorest 2011).  Rotational
  irregularities such as glitches are attributed to the physics of the
  super-dense superfluid present in the neutron star core and so their study
  allows us to probe a physical regime far beyond those that can be reached
  in laboratories on Earth (e.g. Lattimer &amp; Prakash 2006; Espinoza et al
  2011). These glitches might also trigger heating of the neutron star
  surface or magnetic reconnections which can be studied in either or both
  gamma-rays and X-rays. They may also cause sufficient deformation of the
  neutron star that it might be a gravitational wave emitter. To allow these
  follow-up observations requires the accurate determination of glitch
  occurence times which can be achieved through regular monitoring with
  LOFAR. Moreover the high energy emission from pulsars which is presently
  being studied in detail by the FERMI satellite and other telescopes like
  MAGIC (e.g. Abdo et al.  2009) and the search for non-burst like
  gravitational waves from pulsars (e.g. Abott et al. 2010) can only be
  performed with the provision of accurate pulsar rotational histories.
  Three relatively recently discovered manifestations of radio emitting
  neutron stars, the RRATs, the intermittent pulsars and the radio emitting
  magnetars can all greatly benefit from the monitoring capabilities of
  LOFAR. The RRATs are rotating neutron stars which emit approximately once
  in every 1000 pulses (McLaughlin et al. 2006). So far some 50 sources have
  been discovered but periods and period derivatives have only been
  determined for less than half of them (e.g. Keane &amp; McLaughlin 2011).
  Determining these key parameters as well as better characterising the
  nature of their pulses are essential in understanding their relationship
  to the "normal" pulsars. The intermittent pulsars appear as normal pulsars
  for timescales of days to months, but then suddenly turn off for similar
  periods (Kramer et al.  2006). Remarkably when they turn-off they
  spin-down more slowly than when they are on, providing a unique and
  exciting link with the physics of the emission process itself. Observing
  more on-off transitions is vital to improving our understanding of this
  process. Until recently, magnetars, extremely highly magnetised rotating
  neutron stars, were thought to emit only in gamma-rays and X-rays, however
  two such sources are now known to emit in the radio, albeit in a highly
  variable way. This emission is thought to be triggered by an X-ray burst
  event and to subsequently fade dramatically. However, only by monitoring
  these sources in the radio can we understand the link with the burst and
  how long these sources remain radio emitters.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4.</a> Pulsar Searching</h3>

<h4>All Sky</h4>

  <p>Pulsar surveys remain a vital area of pulsar astronomy because they
  continue to drive important advances in our understanding of these objects
  and related science (e.g., &quot;A Radio Pulsar/X-ray Binary Link&quot;,
  Archibald et al. 2009, Science, 324, 1411; &quot;An Eccentric Binary
  Millisecond Pulsar in the Galactic Plane&quot;, Champion et al. 2008,
  Science, 320, 1309; &quot;A Radio Pulsar Spinning at 716 Hz&quot;, Hessels
  et al. 2006, Science, 311, 1901; &quot;A two-solar-mass neutron star
  measured using Shapiro delay&quot;, Demorest et al. 2010, Nature, 467,
  1081). Simply put, the scientific yield of large-scale pulsar surveys
  comes in two forms:</p>

 <ol>

   <li>Through an increase in the total number of radio-emitting neutron
   stars, which improves our understanding of the population as a whole and
   the relationships between the constituent members. This is especially
   important when, as will be the case with LOFAR, the survey probes a
   portion of the population that has been poorly sampled by previous
   surveys.</li>

  <li>Through the discovery of exotic and sometimes even unique pulsar
  systems which teach us something novel themselves and/or which can be used
  as astrophysical laboratories for testing fundamental physical
  theories.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>Pulsars are steep spectrum objects whose pulsed flux density usually
  peaks in the 100 - 200 MHz range, exactly the frequency range where LOFAR
  will have maximum and unprecedented sensitivity. This, combined with
  LOFAR's huge field-of-view (FoV), make it an excellent telescope for
  carrying out an efficient and sensitive all-Northern-sky pulsar survey.
  The disadvantage of low-frequency pulsar observations is that dispersion
  and scattering of pulses by the interstellar medium is much stronger
  towards low frequencies. Previous pulsar surveys have moved to higher
  frequencies to escape these two forms of pulse smearing. However, the
  natural frequency decimation and the powerful processing capability of
  LOFAR mean that for the first time the dispersion effects can be greatly
  reduced.  Scattering will limit the effective volume of the Galactic disk
  that can be surveyed.  Thus we will probe the nearby regions in the
  Galactic plane while at higher Galactic latitudes, where there are less
  free electrons, we can search to very large distances. To test the
  potential of LOFAR for pulsar surveys we have carried out sophisticated
  simulations using realistic source population and scattering models. These
  show that for an optimized pulsar survey with LOFAR we can find
  approximately 900 new pulsars in the Northern sky (van Leeuwen &amp;
  Stappers 2009) more than doubling the present known population in that
  area.</p>

  <p>The principal scientific goals of an all-sky LOFAR survey are:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Produce a near-full census of the local population of radio-emitting
    neutron stars and extrapolate this for a better understanding of the
    entire Galactic population.</li>

    <li>Discover relativistic binary systems to use for testing gravity in
    the strong-field regime.</li>

    <li>Discover MSPs to use in a pulsar timing array to directly detect
    gravitational waves.</li>

    <li>Characterize the low-frequency transient radio sky on short
    timescales and determine what fraction of radio emitting neutron stars
    are transients.</li>

  </ul>

<h4>GCs and External Galaxies</h4>

  <p>Searches for pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) and nearby galaxies can
  be done with much higher sensitivity than for all-sky surveys, where there
  is always a trade-off between observing time per pointing, i.e.
  instantaneous sensitivity, and the time required to complete the survey.
  GCs represent very compact regions in the sky and are completely confined
  within the LOFAR tied-array beam (even using the whole core in most
  cases).  Thanks to their high stellar densities, GCs can form X-ray
  binaries via exchange interactions, which makes them very good targets for
  MSP searches. In fact, there are already <a
  href="http://www.naic.edu/~pfreire/GCpsr.html">more than 140 pulsars known
  inside 28 globular clusters</a> with the vast majority of them being MSPs
  (see, e.g., Freire 2011). The rich stellar interaction history in GCs, can
  lead to the formation of many exotic systems, like highly eccentric
  binaries (Ransom et al., 2005, Freire et al.  2007), the fastest MSP so
  far (Hessels et al. 2006), and many &quot;black widow&quot; systems (King
  et al. 2005). LOFAR will find many new pulsars, including exotic binary
  systems, that were missed in higher-frequency surveys of Northern sky with
  the Arecibo, GBT and Effelsberg radio telescopes.  The steep spectra of
  pulsars means that they can be brighter at low frequencies. Studies have
  shown that some MSPs do not have turn over in their spectra even down to
  LBA frequencies (Kuzmin &amp; Losovsky, 2001; Kramer et al. 1999). GCs are
  spherically distributed from the Galactic center, and many of them are far
  from the plane. Thus, even being within several kpc, there is not a large
  electron column density along their line-of-sight, and therefore their
  dispersion measure is not very high. The smearing due to dispersion can be
  completely compensated by performing online coherent dedisperion which was
  recently developed and tested, and currently LOFAR can set 40 different
  DMs at one time for different tied-array beams (Mol &amp; Romein 2011).
  LOFAR has already demonstrated its ability to observe known millisecond
  pulsars and produce high-quality profiles never obtained before at such
  lower frequencies. For pulsars within the same GC the dispersion measure
  is constrained to a limited range of values, and combining online coherent
  dedispersion for some median dispersion measure value with offline
  incoherent dedispersion will provide the most effective targeted pulsar
  searches with LOFAR. In addition, to dispersion smearing, the pulsar
  signal will be broadened due to the scattering in the ISM, which could
  hamper detection of MSPs. van Leeuwen and Stappers (2010) have estimated
  that at the frequency of 200 MHz, the limiting dispersion measure is about
  60&ndash;80 pc/cc, and higher for longer-period pulsars. For most of the
  Northern GCs, the dispersion measure is less than 70pc/cc, and LOFAR has
  great potential to detect those MSPs still missing.</p>

  <p>Searching for pulsars in external galaxies is in essence very similar
  to searches in GCs, except that even the closest galaxies, like the
  Magellanic Clouds, are more than 10 times further away than pulsars in our
  Galaxy. Still, at present we already know about 20 extragalactic pulsars
  from both the LMC and SMC, which represent the high-end tail of luminosity
  distribution (Manchester et al. 2006). Going to distances &gt;50 kpc
  significantly reduces the odds of detecting pulsars via standard
  periodicity searches as the pulsar flux decreases as distance squared and
  the signal gets more dispersed and scattered. Extragalactic pulsars,
  however, still can be detected by their single pulses, in particular giant
  pulses (GPs). Giant pulses are observed from both young energetic pulsars,
  e.g. the Crab pulsar, and old millisecond pulsars, like PSR B1937+21.  One
  of the young pulsars in the LMC, B0540-69, was in fact also discovered by
  its giant pulses (Johnston &amp; Romani, 2003). McLaughlin &amp; Cordes
  (2003) estimated the maximum distance from which we can still see GPs from
  young Crab-like and old recycled B1937+21-like pulsars.  They have steeper
  spectral index (-3 to -4.5) and at LOFAR low frequencies can be detected
  from up to 1.5 Mpc for young Crab-like GPs. The potential targets for
  these pulsars are galaxies from the Local Group that have active star
  formation, like Andromeda (M31), Triangulum (M33) and a few irregular
  (IC10) and dwarf irregular galaxies. The majority of nearby Local Group
  galaxies are dwarf spheroidal galaxies with old star populations and,
  thus, are promising sites for recycled MSPs.  Searches of Andromeda, M33,
  and several dwarf galaxies undertaken using the Arecibo, GBT, WSRT, and
  Parkes radio telescopes have so far been unsuccessful or, at best, not
  conclusive (McLaughlin &amp; Cordes, 2003; Rubio-Herrera 2010; Kondratiev
  et al. 2010). LOFAR has enough sensitivity to discover the brightest
  pulses from pulsars in nearby galaxies. The dispersion measures can be as
  low as 30-40 pc/cm^3, but strongly depends on how far the galaxy is away
  from the Galactic disk, and whether we observe it edge-on or face-on. All
  galaxies will fit inside the FoV of the coherent Superterp which can be
  tiled with 127 tied-array beams. The whole Andromeda field with all its
  satellites can be observed simultaneously with about 50 tied-array beams.
  A survey for extragalactic pulsars will allow the possibility to
  investigate the most luminous part of pulsar population and compare it to
  the local distribution, and can be used to trace the history of massive
  star formation, and how it depends on the galaxy type. Extragalactic
  pulsars are independent measures of distance scales to other galaxies, and
  furthermore, they would allow us to probe the intermediate intergalactic
  medium.</p>

<h4>Radio-Quiet Neutron Stars</h4>

  <p>Beyond regular pulsars, other, more exotic neutron stars are seen to
  show transient radio emission.  Several anomalous X-ray pulsars and
  magnetars appear to be only detectable at frequencies near 100 MHz (e.g.
  Malofeev et al.  2006), offering an intriguing possibility to study more
  of these high-magnetic-field objects in the radio band, if confirmed. The
  potential 100-MHz detection of Geminga, a prominent rotation-powered
  pulsar visible at optical, X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths (Malofeev &amp;
  Malov 1997), could exemplify a population of neutron stars that may be
  only detectable at long radio wavelengths. New LOFAR magnetar detections
  would offer insight into both the emission and the behavior of matter in
  ultra-strong magnetic fields.  Similarly, the non-detection of radio
  emission from X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) thus far (e.g.
  Kondratiev et al. 2009), could be due to the beams of these long-period
  sources being quite narrow at high frequencies and there may be a better
  chance to detect them in radio at LOFAR frequencies. In fact, weak radio
  emission from two XDINSs, RX J1308.6+2127 and RX J2143.0+0654, was
  reported by Malofeev et al. (2007) at 111 MHz, but remains unconfirmed. It
  is thus important to detect these sources with LOFAR. The strong magnetic
  fields and X-ray emission of XDINS are very similar to the more distant
  rotating radio transients (RRATS); a firm detection of radio emission from
  XDINS would thus tie together these two so-far distinct populations of
  neutron stars.  Equally important to study are the &sim;30 pulsars discovered
  in blind searches of Fermi gamma-ray photons, many of which do not exhibit
  detectable radio emission (Abdo et al. 2009, Science, 325, 840), as well
  as the hundreds of remaining unidentified gamma-ray sources, many of which
  have spectral characteristics that suggest them as likely pulsars, but
  which have not yet been detected in the radio (e.g. Ransom et al. 2010,
  ApJL, 727, 16). As these sources are generally nearby and dim, the
  detection of even a small number of them has a large impact on the local
  neutron-star density and (millisecond-)pulsar formation rate.</p>

<h3><a name="sect5">5.</a> Polarisation Properties of the Pulsar Population</h3>

  <p>One of the main pulsar characteristics is that a large fraction of
  their emission is highly polarised (up to 100% linear polarisation has
  been observed; Karastergiou et al. 2005). In polarisation, there have been
  very few pulsar surveys that provided statistical information on the
  spectrum of the polarised flux down to low frequencies: Gould &amp; Lyne
  (1998) surveyed 300 pulsars between 1600 and 230 MHz. Although some trends
  in linearly polarised flux (L) were seen in that work, there was no
  conclusive statement on the polarised fraction, L/I, as a function of
  frequency. In addition, those surveys could not probe the interesting
  frequency region of &sim;100 MHz, where several pulsars are expected to
  show a spectral turnover. LOFAR is ideally sensitive at frequencies where
  pulsars are at their brightest. However, we do not know whether this is
  true for the polarised pulsar flux. A combination of polarisation
  measurements in the LBA and HBA bands with polarisation measurements at
  high frequencies will allow us to map the complete spectrum of polarised
  pulsar emission. In addition, the assumption of radius-to-frequency
  mapping (e.g. Kramer et al. 1996) means that these observations will trace
  the open-magnetic field line geometry and give us statistically
  significant clues as to the efficiency of curvature emission at different
  altitudes. The combination of LOFAR data with those from high-frequency
  observations will provide, for the first time, a complete map of the radio
  spectrum of hundreds of polarised pulsars, from tens of MHz to several
  GHz.</p>

  <h4>The effects of ISM Scattering on Polarised Pulsar Emission</h4>

  <p>The inhomogeneous interstellar medium disperses, scatters and rotates
  the plane of polarisation of polarised pulsar signals.  The magnitude of
  all of these effects scales strongly with observing frequency; in the
  LOFAR band these effects will be strongest, which translates to increased
  precision in measuring their effect. Using LOFAR's powerful signal
  processing capabilities allows us to easily measure and correct for pulse
  dispersion and Faraday rotation. However, accounting for pulse scattering
  requires the knowledge of the matter distribution along the line of sight
  (LOS) which is much more difficult to model and correct for. Importantly,
  scattering can depolarise pulsar signals: the multi-path propagation of
  scattered polarised emission means that linearly polarised signals with
  different polarisation states could arrive simultaneously at the
  telescope, resulting in observed signals that are the sum of different
  emission phases. The effect of scattering on pulsar polarisation position
  angles (PAs) and RMs has been clearly displayed in a number of
  publications (Li &amp; Han 2003; Karastergiou 2009; Noutsos et al. 2009),
  where it was shown that the PA profiles of pulsars are flattened by
  scattering, and that scattering causes the amount of Faraday rotation
  (i.e. the rotation measure of RM) to appear variable as a function of
  pulse phase &mdash; although in reality it remains constant across the
  pulse. Also, LOFAR observations of the Crab pulsar &mdash; embedded in the
  Crab nebula &mdash; during a period when the pulsar appeared highly
  scattered, revealed that the polarisation of the pulsar was significantly
  diminished compared to previous epochs. The reduced polarisation by almost
  100% may well be associated with filamentary structure crossing our LOS to
  the pulsar, scattering and depolarising the signal (Wucknitz et al., in
  preparation). Such observations can be used not only to show the effects
  of scattering on polarisation, but also to estimate the size and velocity
  of the scattering screens (see, e.g., Smith et al. 2011). A combination of
  HBA and LBA LOFAR observations of scattered pulsars will provide ample
  bandwidth that could be used to measure and model the ISM effects as a
  function of frequency, and potentially recover the unscattered, intrinsic
  pulse shapes. Ultimately, these observations will be used in the
  development of a global ISM model of our Galaxy.</p>

  <h4>The Galactic Magnetic Field from Pulsar Rotation Measures</h4>

  <p>Pulsars play a central role in detecting interstellar magnetic (ISM)
  fields in the Galaxy.  Polarisation observations of hundreds of pulsars
  have been used in the literature to map the large-scale features of the
  Milky Way's magnetic field (Noutsos et al. 2008; Nota &amp; Katgert 2010;
  van Eck et al. 2011). The linearly polarised pulsar emission is subjected
  to Faraday rotation through the magnetised ISM. The magnitude and
  direction of the magnetic field between us and the pulsars can be detected
  by measuring the RM of pulsars at different locations in the Galaxy.
  Measurements of pulsar RMs becomes a simple matter with the large
  bandwidths and high frequency resolutions of modern backends. LOFAR has
  the advantage of operating at a low frequency, which means that even weak
  magnetic fields corresponding to small RM cause a significant change of
  the linear-polarisation plane with frequency and are therefore easier to
  measure. In addition, LOFAR has a large collecting area and bandwidth,
  which provide a high signal-to-noise in linearly polarised intensity and
  ensures that small pulsar RMs create enough detectable Faraday rotation
  across the band. All of the above are critical for measuring ISM fields
  with LOFAR because - due to limitations imposed by pulse scattering -
  LOFAR is sensitive to nearby pulsars in the Galactic Plane and
  high-latitude pulsars anywhere in the Galaxy. Those pulsars are expected
  to have small RMs. The sensitivity of LOFAR together with the increasing
  pulsar brightness towards low frequencies will yield a new population of
  dim pulsars that could not be found in high-frequency surveys. These
  pulsars are invaluable for the studies of the Galactic magnetic field:
  upon measuring their RMs, they will provide new information about the
  strength and direction of the magnetic field in previously unexplored
  directions and locations in the Galaxy. More specifically, very little is
  known about the magnetic field properties of the Milky Way beyond a few
  hundred parsecs from the Galactic Plane. Extra-galactic polarised sources,
  assumed to be at infinite distance, have been successfully used to probe
  large-scale trends as a function of longitude and latitude; with pulsars
  at known distances we can truly map the field's strength and direction as
  a function of Galactic height; this will yield properties, like the
  scale-height and symmetry of the large-scale configuration that remain
  unknown or, at least, uncertain. Critically, those pulsars found nearby in
  the Galactic Plane will increase the number of sightlines in the solar
  neighbourhood. The increased statistics will help us determine local
  structures (interstellar bubbles) that are not associated with a global
  magnetic field configuration but distort the polarised signals passing
  through them. Knowledge of the location of such features will be used to
  estimate their impact on global models of the Galactic magnetic field.
  Another exciting prospect is the possibility of detecting, for the first
  time, ordered magnetic fields in globular clusters (A. Scaife, priv.
  communication). For example, the globular cluster M15 contains several
  known pulsars with accurately known ephemerides. The two brightest pulsars
  in M15, PSRs J2129+1210A,B, are ideally located on opposite sides of the
  cluster's barycentre, which provides a good separation in terms of
  magneto-ionic content and, possibly, a difference in the magnetic field
  direction (i.e. opposite RM sign). If polarisation is detected from those
  pulsars, it will be possible to measure their RMs and infer an average
  magnetic field magnitude. The RM difference between these pulsars is
  expected to be very small (&sim;0.1 rad / m<sup>2</sup>). Hence, these
  observations will need to take advantage of the sensitivity of LOFAR and
  its large fractional bandwidth, but will also required careful ionospheric
  calibration.</p>

<h3><a name="sect6">6.</a> Using Single Stations for Pulsars</h3>

  <p>The properties of individual LOFAR stations make them particularly
  competitive instruments for pulsar and fast transient science.
  Specifically, the 96 elements of the HBA and LBA arrays in the
  international stations add up to sensitivity levels comparable to a third
  of the LOFAR Superterp, which is sufficient to detect single pulses from a
  sizeable sample of bright pulsars. Individual stations can either be
  controlled centrally, in which case the data flow back to the Netherlands,
  or locally by means of additional hardware and software.  One solution for
  single station processing and recording is the <a
  href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/research/artemis">ARTEMIS</a> system.
  ARTEMIS stands for "Advanced Radio Transient Event Monitor and
  Identification System".  The hardware consists of 4 24-core servers
  connected to 4 high end NVIDIA GPU cards. These are all fed data through a
  broadband (10-Gigabit Ethernet) switch, which is also responsible for
  sending the data back to the Netherlands during normal LOFAR operations.
  The servers are also connected via ethernet to a network storage device.
  The beam-formed data being created adds up to a stream of 3.2 Gigabits/s,
  which consists of a sky bandwidth of approximately 48 MHz, sampled at 5
  microsecond intervals, in two polarisations. The ARTEMIS servers perform
  in real-time all the operations necessary to record data in a format that
  can be processed by standard pulsar software, and which is needed discover
  short duration radio pulses from pulsars and fast transients.  Software
  modules exist for receiving the data, for channelisation into finer
  frequency channels, generation of Stokes parameters, excision of radio
  frequency interference, integration, real-time searches for dispersed
  radio pulses and detection of interesting signals.</p>

  <p>Given the properties of single LOFAR stations, there are specific
  science areas which substantially benefit from observations with single
  stations. These include:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>Real-time, large field-of-view monitoring for fast radio transients
    and individual pulses from pulsars.</li>

    <li>Dispersion measure and scattering monitoring for high-precision
    timing experiments.</li>

    <li>Single pulse and variability studies of the known pulsar population
    over very wide bandwidths.</li>

    <li>Monitoring of intermittent pulsars, particularly during state
    transition.</li>

    <li>Polarisation and rotation measure monitoring of interesting known
    pulsars.</li>
