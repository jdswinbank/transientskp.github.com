<p>Proposed talk abstract: One of the data product deliverables of LOFAR is a spectral light-curve database, with real-time capabilities. It is expected to grow constantly and gradually with 50‚&agrave;&iacute;100 TB/yr. I will show how the Transients Key Science Project approaches these challenges by using column-stores, sharded databases and implementing the new array query language SciQL on a multi-node platform. </p><p></p><hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="Pietka"></a><p>Name: Gosia Pietka </p><p>Institute: University of Southampton </p>

<p>Proposed talk title: Single pulses from the pulsars B0809+74 and B1133+16 with LOFAR LBAs</p>
<p>Proposed talk abstract: We report on the results of our observations of bright narrow-band pulses from the nearby pulsars B0809+74 and B1133+16 with the LOFAR at the frequency range of 15-63 MHz. Identified first by Ul'yanov et al. in 2006 using the UTR-2 radio telescope at frequencies 
below 30 MHz, intensity of these pulses was shown to be strongly modulated both in time and frequency. LOFAR's much broader frequency range allows to study them in more detail. We discuss the possible origin of these pulses and its relation to other single-pulse phenomena like giant pulses.</p>

<p>Proposed talk abstract: In spring 2011, a newly developed backend (ARTEMIS) was borrowed from Oxford university to perform test observations of pulsars at the Nan√ßay LOFAR station in stand-alone mode. Recently a similar backend (ALLEGRO) was designed by Nan√ßay engineers. Part of this machine has since been built, tested and approved with the remaining part being under construction. I will present the ARTEMIS/ALLEGRO backend, show results from first observations and discuss future observing plans.</p>

<p>Proposed talk abstract: Over recent years, in-depth studies of pulsed, sporadic and time variable decametric radioemissions were carried out at the large UTR-2 radiotelescope. Many results have been obtained for the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, the interplanetary medium, pulsars and active stars. Methods of observations and examples of dynamic spectra are presented.</p>

<p>Proposed talk title: Use of the complex dynamic cross-spectrum for indentifying sporadic radio emissions</p>
<p>Proposed talk abstract: The UTR-2 radiotelescope configuration allows to implement different methods of observation for more reliable identification of weak sporadic radio emission in the presence of strong interference and ionospheric perturbations. One of them consists of measuring the dynamic phase and amplitude cross spectrum of the signals at the output of different parts of the UTR-2 radio telescope. Examples of results are presented for active stars, Saturn's lightning, etc.</p>

<p>Proposed talk title: Recent results of pulsars and planets at UTR-2</p>
<p>Proposed talk abstract: We present results of the re-detection of known pulsars in frame of new decameter survey at UTR-2. Due to the improvement of backends, 
more than 50% of the 80 observed pulsars were detected instead of the dozen previously detected at decameter wavelengths. Together with refined dispersion measures, we measured flux density, pulse width and other parameters. We explore the possibility of detecting new transients radio sources at extremely low frequencies.</p><p></p><hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="Belletoile"></a><p>Name: Belletoile Arnaud </p><p>Institute: Subatech </p>
<p>Proposed talk title: Joint operation of the LSS and CODALEMA to explore high energy cosmic ray physics </p>
<p>Proposed talk abstract: The CODALEMA experiment is dedicated to high energy cosmic ray physics via the novel method of radio detection. Its original setup is currently going through a major upgrade with the deployment around the existing apparatus of an additional array of 60 standalone new generation detection stations that will surround the existing Nancay LOFAR station and the future LSS. A joint operation of those instruments is of a major interest for high energy cosmic ray physics as they offer complementary designs : the LSS provides a high density antenna array and CODALEMA a large detection surface. We should then benefit from those features to improve the current understanding of the radio emission in the shower and explore high energy cosmic ray physics in the 10^16 ‚&agrave;&iacute;10^18 eV energy range. The new experimental setup of CODALEMA together with its first results will be introduced. Its scientific objectives will be discussed in light of a possible joint analysis with the LSS project. </p><p></p><hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="Prasad"></a><p>Name: Peeyush Prasad </p><p>Institute: University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands </p>
