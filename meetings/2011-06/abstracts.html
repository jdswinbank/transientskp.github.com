<strong>Title</strong>

<p>Modeling the radio signature of the orbital parameters, rotation,
and magnetic field of exoplanets</p>

<strong>Abstract</strong>

<p>Since the first extra-solar planet discovery in 1995, several hundreds of
these planets have been discovered. Most are hot Jupiters, i.e. massive
planets orbiting close to their star. These planets may be powerful radio
emitters. We simulate the radio dynamic spectra resulting from various
interaction models between an exoplanet and its parent star, i.e.
exoplanet-induced stellar emission and three variants of the exoplanet's
magnetospheric auroral radio emission (full auroral oval, active sector fixed
in longitude, and active sector fixed in local time). We show the physical
information about the system that can be drawn from radio observations, and
how this can be achieved. This information includes the magnetic field
strength and the rotation period of the emitting body (planet or star), the
orbital period, the orbit's inclination, and the magnetic field tilt relative
to the rotation axis or offset relative to the center of the planet. For most
of these parameters, radio observations provide a unique means of measuring
them. Our results should provide the proper framework of analysis and
interpretation for future detections of radio emissions from exoplanetary
systems -- or from magnetic white dwarf-planet or white dwarf-brown dwarf
systems --, that are expected to commence soon as part of extensive programs
at large radiotelescopes such as LOFAR, UTR2 or the GMRT. Our methodology can
be easily adapted to simulate specific observations, once effective detection
is achieved.</p>

<p>Constraints on Low Frequency Emission from Brown Dwarfs</p>

<b>Abstract</b>

<p>Ultracool dwarfs occupy the region of parameter space intermediate in mass
and temperature between stars and planets.  The masses and temperatures of
those objects which display detectable levels of cm-wavelength radio emission
are closer to the stellar than the planetary regime, however the radio
properties of some of these objects are more similar to the solar system giant
planets.  The rotationally modulated emission seen at cm-wavelengths has been
interpreted as an electron cyclotron maser operating close to the surface of
the star.  The coincidence of emission at both 3.6 and 6 cm has been  further
interpreted as evidence of masing conditions in different parts of the
atmosphere.  We performed a series of observations at 330 MHz targeting two
well known ultracool dwarfs which exhibit periodic radio emission, in order to
explore the nature of the low frequency radio emission.  We discuss the
constraints which our upper limits provide on the plasma environment and the
requirements for future observations to make advances in understanding the
magnetic nature of  ultracool dwarfs.</p>

<b>Title</b>

<p>Towards a Dynamic LOFAR Catalogue</p>

<b>Abstract</b>

<p>LOFAR will observe tens of millions of sources. Most of the sources will be
revisited many times every second, whereas millions of measurements of the
same source are no exception. I will present the state of the current
framework for detecting transient and variable sources.<br> Furthermore, I
will discuss the distributed database system in which all the LOFAR
measurements for all the sources detected by LOFAR can be appended and
accessed: the light-curve database. This system is frequently updated with the
latest LOFAR observations. Up-to-date sky models are retrieved from here as
well.</p>
