<h2>The Anton Pannekoek Institute</h2>

</br>

Our visitor address is:

<blockquote style="padding:5px; border:thin solid blue;">
Science Park 904<br>
1098 XH Amsterdam
</blockquote>

<p>You can recognise the faculty building by the two domes on top; the
institute is located right under the domes. The building is also (currently)
the largest building in the Science Park. Walk under the building between the
pillars into the central area to find the main entrance. From there, follow
the signs to the meeting room. Note that on the first day we will be in room
C1.112: if you get lost, you can always ask for directions at reception.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>Public transport in Amsterdam is generally very good: trams, metro, buses
and train will get you to most places. All public transport except trains is
paid for using the &quot;OV&quot; smartcard system: you can either buy a
single-use card on the vehicle (&euro;2.60 entitles you to an hour of travel,
including as many changes as you like) or get a rechargeable card from a
vending machine or kiosk at the station (you need the &quot;GVB&quot;
machines, not the yellow &quot;NS&quot; ones). When travelling by OV card,
always remember to swipe your card when entering and exiting the vehicle!</p>

<p>For travel by train, you should buy a paper ticket. These are available
from the yellow &quot;NS&quot; vending machines (widespread at the airport
and railway stations), or from the sales staff at major stations. You must
buy your ticket before boarding the train.</p>

<p>Maps and timetables of the Amsterdam area public transport system are
available from <a href="http://www.gvb.nl/">GVB</a>, the operator. <a
href="http://www.9292ov.nl/">9292ov</a> and <a
href="http://maps.google.co.uk/">Google Maps</a> both provide convenient
journey planners which are aware of public transport: just tell them where
you are and where you want to go, and they will suggest the best options.</p>

<h2>Getting to the Institute</h2>

<h3>From the <a href="accommodation.html">Hotel Eden</a></h3>

<p>There are various ways to reach the Institute by public transport from the
workshop hotel. The total journey time is about half an hour (or an hour, if
you prefer to walk). Excellent directions are available from <a
href="http://goo.gl/maps/R886">Google Maps</a>.</p>

<h3>From Amsterdam Centraal station</h3>

<p>If you are coming from Amsterdam Centraal station, the best option is to
take the train to Amsterdam Science Park station, and follow the directions
as above. Trains to the Science Park leave at 18 and 48 minutes past the
hour.</p>

<p>When exiting the Science Park station, turn left into the tunnel. Once
through the tunnel, you'll find yourself in the Science Park, and probably
can spot the API domes towards the right of your front. The science faculty
building is the largest building in the Science Park.</p>

<h3>From Schiphol Airport</h3>

<p>At Schiphol, buy a ticket for Amsterdam Science Park station. Take the
train to Amsterdam Centraal station, and follow directions as above.</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>If Amsterdam Amstel station is more convenient for you to reach (there are
direct trains from Utrecht to Amsterdam Amstel, and the metro stops there as
well), take bus 40 from Amsterdam Amstel station (every fifteen minutes) and
get out at bus stop Science Park (some ten minutes from the station). The bus
may go around the building first before stopping here, but there are bus
stops at either side of the building.</p>

<p>Other options consist of taking bus 40 from Muiderpoort station to Amsterdam
Amstel in the opposite direction, or taking tram line 9 and exiting at stop
"Kruislaan". From there you can walk or catch bus 40 again.</p>
