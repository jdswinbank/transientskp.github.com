<h1>Internet Access</h1>

<h2>eduroam</h2>

<p>Wireless internet access will be available at the workshop using
the <a href="http://www.eduroam.org/">eduroam</a>
system. Pariticipants whose home institutions are members of the
eduroam scheme (see the <a
href="http://www.eduroam.org/#eduroam-map-world">map provided by
eduroam</a>) should be able to connect to the local wireless network
with no additional configuration. Contact your <em>home
institution's</em> IT support department for details on how to set
this up.</p>

<p>We will also provide a separate wireless service for participants
from institutions which are not eduroam members.</p>
