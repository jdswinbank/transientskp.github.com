  A LOFAR Transients Key Science Project meeting is being held in Amsterdam on
  3&ndash;5 December 2012. This coincides with the start of LOFAR &quot;Cycle
  0&quot;; a major theme of the meeting will therefore be to ensure we are
  best able to take advantage of the anticipated avalanche of data. Of course,
  we will also consider longer term plans and ongoing development. All
  Transients Key Project members and invited guests are welcome.
