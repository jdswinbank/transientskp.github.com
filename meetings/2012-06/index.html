    <br>
    <br>

    <b>REGISTRATION</b><br>
    <br>
    The cost of the meeting is (a heavily subsidised) &pound;60 for lunches, coffee, and refreshments. The conference fee can be paid <a href="http://www.oxforduniversitystores.co.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&catid=1215&modid=1&prodid=4768&deptid=114&prodvarid=0">here</a>.<br>

    <b>ACCOMMODATION</b><br>
    <br>
    It would be best to stay as near St. Anne's College as possible. There are various recommended hotels available in Oxford, but bear in mind that it is less expensive (and perhaps more of an interesting experience) to stay in one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges_of_the_University_of_Oxford">Oxford's Colleges</a> or local B&B<br>
    <br>

    <b>DIRECTIONS</b><br>
    <br>
    St. Anne's College is a 5-minute walk from the Oxford Astrophysics Department. We recommend that you stay near central Oxford.<br>
    <br>
    Ways to get to Oxford:<br>
    </p>
    Rail: There are regular services from London Paddington. There are also regular links to other parts of the country via, Didcot, Reading and Birmingham. (<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" title="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">Interactive timetable from National Rail</a> - enter London Paddington for trains to/from London.) Oxford station is about a mile from the Department. The Cityline 2A bus service runs by the labs, from the train station Monday to Saturday. The stop is on Banbury Road at the intersection with Keble Road - see Physics Department map below.</p>
    Coach/bus: Two services operate from London: one leaves from Victoria Coach Station every 15 minutes during weekdays (<a href="http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=27" title="http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=27">Oxford Express</a>); the other from Grosvenor Gardens by Victoria Railway Station every 10 minutes at peak times (<a href="http://www.oxfordtube.com/" title="http://www.oxfordtube.com/">Oxford Tube</a>). Both services pick up at Marble Arch. The Oxford coach station is about half a mile from the Department - see city centre map below. There is also a coach service from Cambridge (<a href="http://www.stagecoachbus.com/" title="http://www.stagecoachbus.com/">X5 via Milton Keynes</a>).</p>
    Air: There are frequent coach services to Heathrow and Gatwick (<a href="http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=23" title="http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=23">The Air Line</a>). The journey takes just over an hour on a good day (a little longer from Terminal 4). <a href="http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=8" title="http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=8">Tickets can also be bought on-line</a>. There is a free shuttle service between Terminal 4 and the other terminals. A taxi from Heathrow to Oxford will cost you at least &pound;50. Most taxis take four passengers. This is a rather expensive way of arriving at Oxford. There is a less frequent service to Stansted Airport (<a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/" title="http://www.nationalexpress.com/">757 via Stansted</a>). From <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/" title="http://www.nationalexpress.com/">Luton airport, a coach runs every 2 hours</a>. The journey time is around 2 hours. More frequent connections are available by train. Trains run from Luton Airport Parkway station to Oxford via London. Two changes are necessary, the train arrives at St Pancras then you must take an underground link to Paddington, from which trains run to Oxford, see <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" title="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/</a>. The journey time is about 3 hrs. . Birmingham International Airport (BHX) is a good alternative airport for travelling to Oxford. The train station is linked to the passenger terminals by a free, frequent Air-Rail link, which runs every 2 minutes from 0515 to 0200. The journey time is less than 2 minutes. There is a frequent train service from Birmingham International train station to Oxford, and the journey time is approximately one hour.
