They spend the majority of their lives in a quiescent, low-luminosity state, but occasionally brighten by several orders of magnitude as they undergo giant flares.  These spectacular outbursts will be prime targets for study with LOFAR, which, in its radio sky monitor mode, will alert the wider community to new outbursts and allow us to study them in the radio band in unprecedented detail.  I will give an overview of X-ray binary research, and summarize what we have learned from previous low-frequency radio observations by existing facilities, presenting observations made with the WSRT and VLA in order to help characterise the emission from these sources in the relatively unexplored low-frequency regime.  I will review the theoretical predictions for what we can expect to see with LOFAR, and suggest how its unprecedented sensitivity and resolution at these frequencies can be used to answer some of the pressing questions in the field.

With the future demise of purpose-built X-ray timing instruments suited to long term monitoring of X-ray binaries, LOFAR will be on the front line for detecting and monitoring transient X-ray binary outbursts.  X-ray binaries will also be the brightest transient sources in Galactic Plane and hence understanding the processes occuring during an outburst are vital.  I will present the method and reasoning behind this new diagnostic diagram and how LOFAR observations will further enhance its usefulness in studying the behaviour of X-ray binaries.

          <div id="absdiv29"><p>The magnetic field of a compact object can present a barrier to the the accretion flow towards it in an interacting binary.  In extreme cases the magnetic field can prevent the formation of an accretion disc altogether and rather eject the material from the system as happens around the rapidly rotating white dwarf in AE Aqr, which frequently flares at radio wavelengths.  I will present recent observations of AE Aqr at submillimeter wavelengths using the LABOCA bolometer on Apex.
</p>
<p>In those cases when an accretion disc does form the magnetic field diffuses into the disc and couples the disc to the compact object.  They can then exchange angular momentum, which can be studied through the variations in the spin periods of disc-accreting X-ray pulsars.  The standard model of this interaction neglects the role of an intrinsic magnetic field in the disc, but in view of the magnetohydrodynamic nature of the turbulence in an accretion disc one should take into account the effect of a disc dynamo on the exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disc and the compact object.

Magnetic fields seem to be crucial for this phenomenon to work.
</p>
<p>Especially in young stars, the most nearby accretion/ejection sources, this process can be studied in great detail. I will review the current knowledge on accretion and the highly collimated jets in young stars, and report on recent observations that support the importance of magnetic fields for the jet formation and collimation. I will highlight the transient character of the phenomena in the jets and their sources.

Due to the selection effects inherent in their detection, there may be more RRATs than normal radio pulsars. Therefore, understanding their emission processes and their relationships to other classes of neutron stars is an important goal. In this talk, I will describe our recent progress in searching for new RRATs, obtaining phase-connected timing solutions for RRATs, and observing RRATs at other wavelengths. I will discuss the implications of the new results for the RRATs place in the zoo of Galactic neutron stars, and for the numbers of such sources detectable in ongoing and future surveys.

The highest frequency covered by these instruments is 40 MHz, so that the high frequency spectrum of Saturn lightning remains unknown. Also, in the past, only the average spectrum could be determined. Using a new broadband receiver at UTR-2 (Ukraine), SED were detected over the 
   whole spectral range of the instrument (10-30 MHz) in December 2007. For the first time, this allows to study the instantaneous spectrum of the discharge. However, this study is limited to frequencies below 30 MHz.
   LOFAR will allow to greatly extend this frequency range, giving information on the slope of the SED spectrum and the energy of the discharge. LOFAR will also allow to directly observe the temporal fine structure of the emission, solving the standing problem of the stroke duration.

          <div id="absdiv5"><p>Recent studies of cyclotron maser emission mechanism have shown that energetic electron beams are capable of producing intense coherent radio emission from magnetized objects. Studies of strongly magnetized brown dwarfs, flare stars and MCP stars (for example CU Virginis generate strong coherent maser emission that is also  characteristic of radio bursts from planets. The radio signature from CU Virginis is particularly interesting since it is of a pulsed nature reminiscent of pulsar radiation.  The pulse period is equal to the rotations period of the oblique rotator CU Virginis just as in pulsars.  LOFAR will be able to resolve the emitting region and shed light on emission mechanisms.  One mechanism that is distinct from the usual loss - cone process is the direct radiation from an energetic electron beam moving into a converging magnetic field.   It is conceivable that this mechanism can operate in pulsar magnetospheres. We present the theory, laboratory experimental results and astrophysical obervations demonstrating the applicability of the model.

The expectation of detectable stellar cm-wave and X-ray emission was initially pessimistic based on scaling the Sun’s observed range of flux densities; happily the fields of stellar X-ray emission and cm-wavelength radio emission have matured in the roughly three decades since sensitive detectors capable of good-quality spatial discrimination were deployed.  I will discuss lessons learned from experience with Swift triggering on large stellar flares as a different philosophical approach to observing stellar transient emissions.  In order to be fair and balanced, I will also play devils’s advocate and present some arguments for why there may not be as many stellar transient low frequency signals as expected by extrapolating from the behavior of a few well-studied systems.

The second objective is to discover, classify and interpret previously undetected transient events in these archival observations.  A sample of images is currently being produced from the ATCA and VLA archives and will consist of commonly observed astronomical and calibration fields.  The total number of images hopefully reaching many thousands. The author will present in his talk an overview of the pipeline imaging techniques used to interrogate these archives.

The development of a comprehensive understanding of a new event requires real-time observation with multiple instruments. VOEventNet (Caltech, NOAO Tucson and Exeter UK) provides access to a wide range of astronomical events, the X and gamma-ray satellites in space, two microlensing projects, asteroids, several synoptic surveys in optical wavelengths, and others. There is no human in the loop: astronomical alerts and reports are uploaded to a publisher node in a special format, then automatically added to the web pages and also forwarded to other brokers in the network. VOEventNet (voeventnet.org) supplies Google Sky with part of the "Current Sky Events" layer. We are now building a customized subscription service for these events. The idea is that both people and robotic systems can get the alerts quickly enough to respond with follow-up observations. Events have persistent identifiers based on the notion of event Stream: meaning a scientifically uniform set of observations that have not yet happened -- a "catalog of future observation". I will briefly cover authoring and publishing, discovery of event nodes, the Google layer, and subscription to event streams. I hope that LOFAR transients can be included in VOEventNet.

          <div id="absdiv9"><p>The Allen Telescope Array (ATA), dedicated on October 11, 2007 at Hat Creek, California, is currently undertaking transient surveys of the radio sky at 1.4 GHz. We will discuss ATATS (the ATA Twenty-cm Survey), an 800 square degree field which we have mapped repeatedly (19 times, as of September 2008) in a search for transient sources. As well as searching for changes from epoch to epoch, we are also able to build up a deep, multi-epoch image and associated catalog of the sky, which we can compare to previous surveys such as NVSS.
</p>
<p>We present the ATA survey strategy, and the data reduction and transient detection pipelines. We hope that our strategy for studying transients with ATA can inform the LOFAR strategy, and vice versa.

   is sensitive to gamma rays with energies between 20 MeV and &gt; 300 GeV.
   In addition to breakthrough capabilities in energy coverage and localization,
   the very large field of view enables observations of 20% of the sky at any instant,
   and the entire sky on a timescale of a few hours. With its recent launch on 11 June 2008,
   Fermi now opens a new and important window on a wide variety of phenomena, including
   pulsars, black holes and active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, ...
</p>
<p>Compared to previous telescopes, Fermi and Lofar will give a two-order magnitude
   improvement in term of daily sensitivity. They will provide a continuous all sky monitor
   (only Northern Hemisphere for LOFAR) in the two extreme parts of the electromagnetic
   spectrum.  In this talk, I will focus on the Fermi/LOFAR capabilities  in order to probe
   the nature of the non thermal transient Universe.

   ULTRACAM provides three-colour imaging at frame rates of up to 500 Hz on 4-m and 8-m class telescopes. ULTRASPEC provides intermediate resolution spectroscopy at up to 20 Hz with zero readout noise on 4-m (and hopefully in the future 8-m) telescopes. Such facilities will be crucial to perform follow up optical observations of the very faintest, most rapidly varying signals discovered by LOFAR.

Since early 2006, we have performed multi-waveband optical photometry of LMXBs using the Faulkes Telescope North on Haleakala, Maui, and have added the Faulkes Telescope South at Siding Spring, Australia since summer 2007. We have detected outburst activity in six sources and variability in quiescence in many others. 
</p>
<p>Aside from our weekly monitoring of these sources, we are able to react to any outbursts or increased activity, either noted by us, or in Astronomers Telegrams. In these instances, we are able to increase the frequency of our observations or perform studies to detect orbital modulations.

          <div id="absdiv24"><p>MAGIC is a single Cherenkov telescope sensitive to Very High Energy (VHE)
   gamma rays above 25 GeV. Since it started operations in 2004 it has
   detected several galactic and extragalactic radio sources, some of them
   variable and/or transient. Among the galactic sources we can emphasize the
   detection and discovery of periodic TeV emission from the peculiar X-ray
   binary LS I +61 303, as well as experimental evidence of a TeV flare from
   the accreting stellar-mass black hole Cygnus X-1. Among the extragalactic
   sources we detected the radio galaxy M87 and several AGNs, including
   High-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects and the first detections of two
   Low-frequency-peaked BL Lacs and a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar. Some of
   these AGNs were detected/discovered after triggering from our parallel
   optical monitoring program. We have also observed several Gamma Ray Bursts
   with typical slewing times of 50s after receiving external triggers, with
   no detection up to now. In 2009 we will start operating a second
   telescope, MAGIC-II. Together with the MAGIC-I telescope, stereoscopic
   observations will become possible, thus improving the background
   rejection, the sensitivity and the energy and angular resolution of the
   system. The new MAGIC-stereo system of telescopes will allow us to conduct
   detailed follow-up studies of transient sources between 25-100 GeV, not
   achievable with other Cherenkov telescopes, after receiving alerts from
   other facilities such as LOFAR.

          <div id="absdiv7"><p>The observation of an electromagnetic counterpart to a putative gravitational wave transient would be one of the more convincing smoking guns for the first direct detection of gravitational waves, and would open up a new observational method for the study of compact objects and strong gravitational fields. The LIGO scientific collaboration and the VIRGO collaboration operate a total of five broadband ground-based gravitational wave interferometers in North America and Europe. Gravitational wave transients received by a network of such instruments should allow the reconstruction of the point of origin of the signal on the sky, permitting follow-up electromagnetic observations. Low frequency radio transients detected by LOFAR are also interesting sources for follow-up analysis of gravitational wave data. After outlining the principles of gravitational wave interferometry and the status and planned schedule for the instruments, we discuss astrophysical sources that make promising candidates for collaborative searches  and give a tentative indication of requirements for a LOFAR transient survey to maximize the probability of successful joint observations.
